  I'm occassionally asked "What is the best language for me to learn?", my response, "Don't learn a language, learn to program!"

In my role as a technology leader, I'm occassionally asked by people looking to
develop their career and move into software engineering:

<blockquote>
  What is the best language for me to learn?
</blockquote>

My response is always the same, and has been for many years: 

<blockquote>
  Don't learn a language, learn to program.
</blockquote>

This probably requires some explanation to anyone who is not familiar with
software engineering practices. Dedicating time to learning a specific language
will ultimately be a limiting factor in your career progression. By
specialising to the level of a specific language, you're implicitly limiting
your options. While this might not seem too big a deal in the moment, it will
become important before too long. You've only got to look at the various
reports available on the internet to realise the futility of this approach. As
an example, the [Fossbytes report for
2017](https://fossbytes.com/best-popular-programming-languages-2017/) shows
Javascript as top, no surprise there, more interesting are languages that
appear further down, such as Go, and Swift. Swift, in particular, only came
onto the scene in 2014, and is already showing in the lists. What's more, where
you look, and what factors apply, will give you a completely different view of
the most in-demand languages,
[Techworld](http://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/careers/uks-top-12-most-in-demand-programming-languages-3612638/)
lists SQL as the top, and neiher Swift nor Go get a look in.

This just goes to show the fickle nature of programming languages and their
favour with the community and industry. Any time spent focusing on learning a
particular language will have an implicit shelf life, and then the cycle will
start all over again. Of course, with each langauge you learn, the next
typically gets easier, unless you're leaping from procedural to functional, or
similar, but it's still a learning curve each time.

A far better approach to assuring your position in the future of software
engineering is not to learn the details of a particular language, but instead to
learn, and learn well, the lessons of software design and architecture, which
can be applied easily irrespective of the language of choice.

I have, through my career, worked with in excess of 40 different programming
languages. Does this mean I can fire up my favourite text editor and start
programming in any one of them, of course, not, and I don't need to. When I
start a new project, I don't begin by thinking about which programming language
I'm going to use, and which language constructs or libraries are appropriate.
Instead I think in concepts, forming the structure of the program at a high
level, what interaction it needs with the external world, what data it might
need to store, how it can process that data effectively. At this point, I
haven't even chosen a language. It may well be that the language is forced upon
me by the nature of the project, but that doesn't matter at this stage. Only
when I'm happy with the overall approach, will I start getting into details of
which language, which runtime, which libraries. The benefit to this approach is
that I don't have to keep the intricate details of 10's of languages in my head
all the time, I keep the principles, and enough high level information about
language options to be able to make sensible assumptions. It's Google all the
way from there. Why retain the syntax details of Javascript or JQuery, when I
can find them in a second when I need them?

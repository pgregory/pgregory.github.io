  Could a return to bedroom hacking be the key to a revival of the fun in
  software development?

As I spend more time exploring the potential of permanent, professional
freelancing, I have been realising there is a pattern to the sort of projects
that I'm drawn to depending on my mood. It didn't take a great deal of time to
work out why, it's because I really enjoy writing simple, casual game code, in
any platform, framework or language.

There's just something about making a game, no matter how simple the game, or
rubbish the artwork. Going from a blank canvas, to something that is actually
fun to play,is a real tonic. As a gamer, no matter how casual or infrequent,
you'll soon get a feel for what is 'good' and what isn't, and it's really fun
to tweak until it does feel good.

For example, I worked on a project recently, very quick turnaround, tight
deadlines, but a well defined scope. It was a simple infinite side-scrolling
run-and-jump game, one button to jump, nothing else at all in the game, think
Google Chrome's [Dino Game](http://apps.thecodepost.org/trex/trex.html). All
the artwork was provided, so that part wasn't an issue, I could get into the
coding right away. The client needed it created with
[L&#214;VE](https://love2d.org/) framework, which worked out great. I have
plenty of experience with [Lua](https://www.lua.org), and some experience with
L&#214;VE, but it would be a fun challenge to get up to speed and productive in
such a short timeframe. As it turned out, it was better than I thought, as
L&#214;VE provides a good deal of the core stuff, but leaves the rest to you.
Scouring the [L&#214;VE wiki](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) and other
community sites, I found a plethora of resources that proved to be incredibly
useful in guiding and offering great inspiration. But the real fun came when
the basics were in place. The original scope was pretty simple, jump over
obstacles, collect tokens. However, I realised after playing that for a short
time that there needed to be more. The jump had to be more controllable,
placing tokens at different heights, and using the supplied obstacles, which
were all different widths and heights, demanded a bit more "gameplay". So I
set to implementing a "jump power control", the longer you held the jump
button, the higher the jump, to a limit. This adds new nuances to the
gameplay, now you have to make a decision very quickly, jump high and get that
token, but risk coming down in a place where you cannot jump the next
obstacle, or miss the token? While this is a very simple example, it
illustrates that, while this was a paying gig, it was the level of interest
and fun that made it worthwhile and engaging as a project for me.

I will definitely be dedicating more time now to just coding games for the fun
of it. Simple games, simple projects, using a variety of platforms and tools
to keep it fresh, but always with the underlying goal to have fun, and not
think at all about the commercial potential, of course, if it turns out to
have commercial potential, that's a bonus!

I highly encourage more people to do this, set aside some of your valuable
time to have fun coding, it will refresh your appetite for it, and you'll
almost certainly learn more doing it than you would writing boilerplate code
for a job, and who knows, you might stumble upon the next great "bedroom hack"
success, by happy accident, but be sure to have fun along the way.
